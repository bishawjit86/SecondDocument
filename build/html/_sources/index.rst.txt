Autofac is an addictive IoC container for Microsoft .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Store apps, and Windows Phone 8 apps. It manages the dependencies between classes so that applications stay easy to change as they grow in size and complexity. This is achieved by treating regular .NET classes as components.
