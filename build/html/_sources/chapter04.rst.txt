CHAPTER FOUR
============
I have used Grammarly for a very long time now and it is one of the writing tools that I use every single day, and all day long.

This is because it works with so many platforms, software and applications, so it is always on and always helping me correct my writing in real time.

While Grammarly has its own desktop app, it also works with Word in Microsoft Office, in any web browser, with WordPress and even on your social media sites. It also works on mobile devices as well as with an iOS Grammarly Keyboard app.

There is also support for Google Docs, but this feature is still in beta.
